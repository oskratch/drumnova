# DrumNova - Redrum-Style Drum Machine

🌐 **[Try the live demo](https://drumnova.oscarperiche.com)**

A personal experiment building an interactive drum machine inspired by Redrum, fully functional in the browser. This is just a fun side project to explore the Web Audio API and create something useful for making beats.

## 🎵 Features

- **16 steps x 8 channels** sequencer grid with multi-block view (1/2/4 blocks visible at once)
- **Block system**: Choose 1, 2, 4, or 8 blocks for extended patterns (up to 128 steps total)
- **Tabbed interface**: Organized controls with BPM, SWING, PATTERN, and REVERB tabs to save vertical space
- **Swing/Shuffle control**: Adjustable groove (0-75%) to add that human feel
- **Velocity per pad**: Ghost notes, normal hits, and accents for dynamic expression
- **Reverb effect**: Master reverb with send control (0-100%) for spatial depth
- **Block navigation**: Switch between blocks to program different sections
- **Seamless playback**: Play travels through all active blocks in sequence
- **Demo patterns** preconfigured (Rock Steady, Funk Soul, Boom Bap, Industrial Pulse, New Wave Icon, Four to the Floor, Tension Build, Poly Rhythm)
- **8 instrument channels**: Kick, Snare, HiHat, Clap, Tom, Perc, Cymbal, FX
- **Multiple sound variations**: 4-5 different sounds per instrument with enhanced synthesis
- **Improved synthesis**: 808-style kicks with pitch envelopes, realistic snares with noise/tone balance
- **Mute buttons**: 🔊/🔇 per channel to silence individual instruments
- **Volume dials**: Individual volume control per channel with rotary knobs
- **BPM control** adjustable (60-200 BPM)
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Space = play/pause, ESC = stop, 1-8 = mute channels, arrows = navigate blocks
- **Master bus compressor**: Professional sound cohesion and punch
- **Save/Load patterns**: Download and upload your patterns as JSON files with all settings preserved
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile with horizontal scroll
- **Visual interface** hardware-style with responsive colors
- **Web Audio API** for low-latency audio playback

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser
2. Click on pads to create your pattern
3. Press **Play** to hear it
4. Adjust **BPM** with the slider
5. Load **demo patterns** to get started quickly

## 🎹 How It Works

### Structure
- Each **row** = an instrument (Kick, Snare, HiHat, Clap, Tom, Perc, Cymbal, FX)
- Each **column** = a beat step
- Each **block** = 16 steps of all instruments
- **Blue pads** = activated
- **Green/yellow pads** = currently playing

### Controls

**Tabs**: Use the tab buttons to switch between different control sections:
- **BPM Tab**: Adjust tempo (60-200 BPM)
- **SWING Tab**: Add groove/shuffle (0-75%) + velocity tips
- **PATTERN Tab**: Save/Load patterns and load demo patterns
- **REVERB Tab**: Add spatial depth with reverb send (0-100%)

**Main Controls**:
- **Play/Pause**: Start or pause playback (shortcut: **Space**)
- **Stop**: Stop and return to beginning (shortcut: **ESC**)
- **Clear**: Erase current visible blocks' patterns (shortcut: **Ctrl+C**)

**Channel Controls**:
- **Sound selectors**: Choose different sounds for each instrument (4-5 variations each)
- **Mute buttons**: 🔊/🔇 per channel to silence individual instruments during playback (shortcuts: **1-8**)
- **Volume dials**: Drag vertically to adjust individual channel volume (0-100%)
- **▶ Preview buttons**: Test individual instrument sounds (plays currently selected variant)

**Block Controls**:
- **Block buttons (1/2/4/8)**: Set how many blocks are active
- **View buttons (1/2/4)**: Set how many blocks are visible at once (default: 2)
- **◄ ► Navigation**: Switch between visible blocks (shortcuts: **Left/Right arrows**)

### Velocity System
Click pads with different modifier keys for dynamics:
- **Normal click**: 70% velocity (standard hit)
- **Shift + click**: 100% velocity (accent - loud, emphasized hit with gold glow)
- **Alt + click**: 30% velocity (ghost note - quiet, subtle hit with darker color)

This allows for realistic, musical patterns with dynamics instead of robotic, same-volume hits.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Space**: Play / Pause
- **ESC**: Stop
- **Ctrl+C**: Clear pattern
- **1-8**: Toggle mute for channels 1-8
- **Left/Right arrows**: Navigate between blocks

### Multi-Block View
By default, **2 blocks** are visible simultaneously, allowing you to see and edit longer patterns at once:
- Click **View: 1/2/4** buttons to change how many blocks are shown
- Visual separators (gold lines) mark block boundaries
- Navigation arrows scroll through blocks
- All editing works seamlessly across visible blocks

### Block System
- **1 block** = 16 steps (basic patterns)
- **2 blocks** = 32 steps (intro + verse, build-ups)
- **4 blocks** = 64 steps (full song sections)
- **8 blocks** = 128 steps (complete compositions)

When loading demo patterns:
- Short patterns (16 steps) fill all active blocks with the same pattern
- Long patterns (32+ steps) automatically expand blocks to fit and distribute across them

## 🔧 Integrating Your Sound Library

Currently uses synthetic sample sounds. To use your own sounds:

### Option 1: Load sounds from JavaScript

```javascript
// In the browser console or in a custom script:
const mySounds = [
    { name: 'kick', url: 'path/to/kick.wav' },
    { name: 'snare', url: 'path/to/snare.wav' },
    { name: 'hihat', url: 'path/to/hihat.wav' },
    { name: 'perc', url: 'path/to/perc.wav' }
];

loadSoundLibrary(mySounds);
```

### Option 2: Load individual sound

```javascript
drumMachine.loadSoundFile('kick', 'sounds/my-kick.wav');
```

### Recommended File Structure

```
DrumNova/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── app.js
└── sounds/
    ├── kick.wav
    ├── kick2.wav
    ├── snare.wav
    ├── snare2.wav
    ├── hihat.wav
    ├── hihat2.wav
    ├── perc.wav
    └── perc2.wav
```

## 💾 Saving and Loading Patterns

### Using the UI (Recommended)

- Click **💾 Save** to download your current pattern as a JSON file
- Click **📁 Load** to upload a previously saved pattern file

The saved file includes:
- Your pattern sequence (all blocks) with velocity data per pad
- BPM setting
- Swing/shuffle amount
- Reverb send amount
- Sound selections for each channel
- Volume levels per channel
- Mute states

Pattern files are backward compatible - old patterns (boolean on/off) work with new features (velocity system).

### Using JavaScript (Advanced)

```javascript
const myPattern = drumMachine.exportPattern();
console.log(JSON.stringify(myPattern));
// Copy the output and save it in a JSON file
```

### Import a pattern

```javascript
const patternData = {
    name: 'My Pattern',
    bpm: 128,
    soundMap: ['kick', 'snare', 'hihat', 'perc'],
    pattern: [
        [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],
        [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0],
        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    ]
};

drumMachine.importPattern(patternData);
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Modify visual style
Edit `style.css` to change colors, sizes, gradients, etc.

### Add more channels or steps
In `app.js`, modify:
```javascript
this.channels = 8;  // Number of rows (instruments)
this.steps = 16;    // Number of columns (beats per block)
```

### Add new demo patterns
In `app.js`, inside `this.demoPatterns`, add:
```javascript
myNewPattern: {
    name: 'My Pattern Name',
    bpm: 120,                     // Recommended BPM
    blocks: 1,                    // 1, 2, 4, or 8 blocks
    soundSelections: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], // Sound variant index per channel (0-4)
    pattern: [
        [1,0,0,0,...], // Kick (8 channels total)
        [0,0,1,0,...], // Snare
        [1,1,1,1,...], // HiHat
        [0,0,0,0,...], // Clap
        [0,0,0,0,...], // Tom
        [0,0,0,0,...], // Perc
        [0,0,0,0,...], // Cymbal
        [0,0,0,0,...]  // FX
    ]
}
```

**Pattern metadata:**
- `bpm`: Sets the tempo automatically when loaded
- `blocks`: Number of blocks (1=16 steps, 2=32, 4=64, 8=128)
- `soundSelections`: Array of 8 indices (0-4) to select which sound variant for each channel
- `pattern`: 2D array - 8 rows (channels) × steps (16 per block)

## 🚧 Future Ideas (Maybe Someday)

### Possible Extensions
- ✅ Export/Import patterns with full settings

- ✅ Tabbed interface to save vertical space
- ⬜ Save to browser localStorage
- ⬜ Copy/paste blocks
- ⬜ Delay effect
- ⬜ Per-channel EQ/filter
- ⬜ Step subdivision (32 steps)
